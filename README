The CoreSymbolicator API is an undocumented API of Apple used in OS
X and assumedly also in iOS.  So this underlying API is copyright Apple.

How this undocumented API works was I think originally
reverse engineered by R J Cooper, Copyright Mountainstorm:

  https://github.com/mountainstorm/CoreSymbolication/

The API is used for example in the atos(1) utility which is used to
"convert addresses to their symbolic equivalents".  And by addresses
what is meant are the kind of addresses one sees in stack traces
during execution or after execution, that is, crash dumps.

One can get such addresses by using the backtrace() API which
comes with OS X (since 10.5), and with backtrace_symbols() one
can get decorated version of the stack frames.  However, the
latter only gives you predecorated opaque strings, and the
source code information (filename and linenumber) are missing.

If you need to have the values for each stack frame in more structured
manner, you might find the Symbolicator API (Symbolicator.h) useful.
This API is essentially just a reshaping of the mountainstorm provided API
into a much simpler form.  Also it is plain C99, so you can easily utilize
this all the members of the C language family, and no XCode is required.

One definite limitation, though: the API works only for the addresses
of the current process.  So no debuggers or crash analyzers.

There is the same problem of predecorated strings with the output of
atos(1).  (Another problem with atos() is that it an external utility,
and launching it takes some time.)

There is a commonly used GNU API called BFD for doing similar "address
to info" things which is available also for OS X, but sadly that does
not work well in OS X, the source code information is unavailable.

An example of using the mountainstorm API:

* https://github.com/frida/frida-gum/blob/master/gum/backend-darwin/gumsymbolutil-darwin.c

Hints to the API can be found in the Apple open source bits like:

* http://opensource.apple.com//source/dtrace/dtrace-168/libproc/libproc.c
* http://opensource.apple.com//source/ChatServer/ChatServer-399/jabber_od_auth/sasl_switch_hit.c

The dtrace sources were used by the mountainstorm reverse engineering effort.
